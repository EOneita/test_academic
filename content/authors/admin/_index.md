bio: I'm Elizabeth Oneita Davis, a Researcher in Community Engagement in the Conservation Science department. I lead the Illegal Wildlife Trade Program, a cross-organizational initiative to support local partners in countering trade and consumption-driven threats to wildlife. In my role I conduct research to inform behavior change campaigns to reduce consumer demand for wildlife in Southeast Asia. I work on every aspect, from the design of surveys and questionnaires, the training of field teams, the analysis of the data, and the interpretation of the data for lay audiences, scientists, and practitioners. I am committed to capacity enhancement and teach incredible students and early career researchers across Southeast Asia. In the USA, I teach students in the Advanced Inquiry Masters Program at SDZWA about conservation social science. I work with many partners including Vinh University, Vietnam, the University of Maryland, and Oxford University. As part of my work, I have interviewed women in Cambodia about their use of bear bile to treat pregnancy-related illnesses, and led a countrywide initiative in Vietnam to understand consumers of bear bile for medicine. For every project I work on, my aim is to compassionately understand the individuals involved and work thoughtfully and carefully towards effective demand reduction. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Zoology from the University of St. Andrews, and my doctorate in Anthropology at the University of Bristol. I am a firm believer in the efficacy of mixed methods approaches, cross-discipline collaboration, and empathy in conservation. I am an avid surfer, runner, cyclist, reader and video gamer.
