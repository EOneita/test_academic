The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (SDZWA)'s Asian Landscapes Hub has worked closely with our key partners [Free the Bears](https://freethebears.org/) in Cambodia since 2016. We have conducted consumer research in a number of key locations across the country, from urban Phnom Penh to rural Stung Treng. We have shown in our work that across lifetimes, up to 15% of the people we sampled have used bear bile, and in a single year up to 8% may use bear bile. Although these numbers are low compared to other countries, such as Vietnam, continued use represents a threat to bear populations in Cambodia that are increasingly fragmented due to habitat destruction.

As of early 2021, we are in the process of obtaining permission for a behavior change initiative to be implemented in Stung Treng, northeast Cambodia, which will be evaluated and compared to our baseline prediction of use.
