The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (SDZWA)'s Asian Landscapes Hub has worked closely with our key partners the **Center for Environment and Rural Development** at Vinh University, Vietnam since 2019. We have conducted consumer research across Vietnam, at sites in the north, south, east, and west of the country, and across a diverse rural-urban gradient. We have shown in our work that in central Vietnam approximately 45% of the people we sampled have used bear bile within the last year- representing a significant threat to bear populations in the country. This is compounded by the continuation of bear farming within the country, although the Government of Vietnam has stated their commitment to ending bear farming by 2022.

Currently, we are in the data analysis and processing stage, and post COVID-19 we will begin designing a Theory of Change that can be used to design a targeted behavior change campaign.
