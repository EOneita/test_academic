abstract: Conservationists measuring noncompliance with measures limiting the exploitation of natural resources often ask sensitive questions. However, respondents may distort their answers due to the risk of sanctions, taboos or social norms. Specialized Questioning Techniques (SQTs) can encourage honest answering through protecting respondentâ€™s privacy by design. This study provides a complete overview of the main SQTs, as well as their most recent advances. We performed a scoping review of existing SQTs, starting with those covered in Nuno and St. John (2015). We covered techniques which advanced over the last few years (n = 14), and included techniques that have never been explained in a conservation context before (n = 2), or that were invented after 2015 (n = 4), like the parallel model, the pair method, the list method and the person count technique. We explained each technique with real, or hypothetical, examples and also discussed advantages and limitations, emphasizing the need to understand the context where they are applied and to imagine the potential repercussions of SQTs, to protect both respondents and their communities. SQTs developed impressively over the last few years, and many different techniques are available to elicit sensitive behaviors with implications for conservation. This research offers a summary to conservationists and practitioners who want to approach this topic and integrate them in their work.
